# Milestones for Tonal

These are the initial draft of milestones and a description of the user interactions. Once revised, these can go into Issues and Milestones.

## Milestone 1

- Access microphone and record audio
- Process audio file into a recognizable frequency contour
- Display the frequency contour

## Milestone 2

- Process audio in realtime (without recording)
- Display frequency contour in realtime

## Milestone 3

- Determine the thresholds for successful frequency contour emulation between a fluent speaker and learner
- Compare and evaluate two frequency contours
- Display two frequency contour comparisons

## Milestone 4

- Track comparison history for a user regarding a set of utterances
- Provide scoring information and feedback (correct, incorrect, improvement) for a given training session

## Description of User Interaction

The user will be provided an initial audio and visualization of an utterance. For example:

Thai: Hello = Sawadee krab สวัสดีครับ (animated frequency contour) (animated sami diagram) (animated/video of speaker saying the phrase)

Some or all of this information will be presented as a prompt or initial lesson. Then the user will repeat the utterance.

The users' (animated frequency contour) will display in realtime next to (above/below) the fluent version, and differences will be pointed out which lie outside of the threshold of fluency (e.g., too high, too long, etc.)

A score will be registered for the attempt (0,1,2 for failure, partial success, complete succcess). The aggregated score for the phrase as well as the session and the complete history may also be displayed.

A list of sets of words and phrases can be displayed and the user can select to learn/test each of these sets. Set completion or percent completed can be displayed.

Fluent speakers can create words/utterances and sets of those words/utterances. (this may be a second application, but in any case saving a frequency contour is a needed functionality).

Selecting between different fluent speakers' voices (male/female), and training with multiple fluent speakers' examples.
